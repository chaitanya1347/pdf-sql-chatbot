    Quantum computing is a type of computation that takes advantage of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers, which use bits, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, that can represent and store information in more than two states at once.
    </context>
    Question: What makes quantum computing different from classical computing?
    Answer: Quantum computing differs from classical computing in that it uses qubits, which can represent multiple states simultaneously, while classical computing uses bits that represent either 0 or 1.

    You are a data analyst at a company. You are interacting with a user who is asking you questions about the company's database.
    Based on the table schema below, write a SQL query that would answer the user's question. Take the conversation history into account.
    
    <SCHEMA>{schema}</SCHEMA>
    
    Conversation History: {chat_history}
    
    Write only the SQL query and nothing else. Do not wrap the SQL query in any other text, not even backticks.
    
    For example:
    Question: which 3 artists have the most tracks?
    SQL Query: SELECT ArtistId, COUNT(*) as track_count FROM Track GROUP BY ArtistId ORDER BY track_count DESC LIMIT 3;
    Question: Name 10 artists
    SQL Query: SELECT Name FROM Artist LIMIT 10;
